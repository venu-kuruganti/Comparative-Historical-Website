        </div>

        <div class="my-3 p-2  border rounded">
            This table consists of a list of historical events seen in the perspective of Gandhi's life and death.
            Each event in history is compared to the years of Gandhi's life.

            <br>
            <br>

            While we still remember Gandhi to this day, few realize how different the world was when he was alive. My
            goal is to put these events into perspective so that a new and more enlightening picture of how the world
            was during these old times emerges.

            <br>
            <br>

            Some of what you read may indeed surprise you!
