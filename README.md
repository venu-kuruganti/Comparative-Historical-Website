# Comparative-Historical-Website

This is a list of events that occurred in history compared to the life of Mahatma Gandhi.

It is a tabular list of major world events and starts just a few years before Gandhi's birth and continues on until his death in 1948.

It is to be built using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and KnockoutJS only. I have chosen these technologies because they are free and open source and hosting a website made with these is cheaper than one using ASP.NET MVC. (But that doesn't mean I don't know ASP.NET MVC!!!)
